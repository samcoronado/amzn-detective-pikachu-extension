This extension replaces all occurrences of amazon detective with amazon detective pikachu. The extension is case-sensitive, so only capitalized occurrences will be replaced.

The code for this repo is largely stolen from Tom Maxwell's tutorial describing how to build your own text replacement extension: https://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions/
